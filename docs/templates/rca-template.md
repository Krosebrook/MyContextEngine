## Example: RCA-2024-10-25: Scanner Root Directory Rejection

**Status**: üü¢ Resolved  
**Severity**: High  
**Date**: 2024-10-25  
**MTTR**: 10 minutes  

### Incident Summary
Scanner default C:/ path returns 403 Forbidden, preventing primary workflow.

### Timeline

| Time (UTC) | Event | Actor |
|------------|-------|-------|
| 14:30 | Scanner deployed with whitelist validation | Agent |
| 14:35 | User reports C:/ scan failing with 403 | User |
| 14:37 | Root cause identified: empty string rejection | Agent |
| 14:40 | Patch deployed and verified | Agent |

### Root Cause

**Primary Cause**:  
`path.relative(C:\, C:\)` returns empty string `""`, which was treated as falsy in the whitelist validation logic, causing legitimate root directory scans to be rejected.

**Contributing Factors**:
- Edge case not covered in initial security design
- No integration tests for root path scanning
- Whitelist logic assumed non-empty relative paths

**Why It Wasn't Caught Earlier**:
- Initial testing used subdirectories (e.g., `C:\Users\`) not root drives
- Security review focused on attack vectors, not legitimate use cases

### Impact Analysis

**User Impact**:
- Affected users: 100% (default C:/ path failed)
- Duration: 5 minutes (from user report to fix)
- Severity: High - primary feature completely broken

**Data Impact**:
- Data loss: ‚úÖ None
- Data corruption: ‚úÖ None
- Recovery needed: None

**System Impact**:
- Availability: Scanner endpoint functional but rejecting valid requests
- Performance: No degradation
- Cascade effects: None

### Fix Applied

**Code Changes**:
```diff
- return relativePath && !relativePath.startsWith('..') && !pathModule.isAbsolute(relativePath);
+ return (relativePath === '' || (!relativePath.startsWith('..') && !pathModule.isAbsolute(relativePath)));
```

### Preventative Actions

**Immediate** (Done):
- ‚úÖ Added empty string handling for exact root matches
- ‚úÖ Updated both scan and import endpoints
- ‚úÖ Verified C:\, D:\, / all accepted

**Short-term** (This sprint):
- ‚è≥ Add integration tests for root path scanning
- ‚è≥ Add test coverage for edge cases (empty string, exact matches)

**Long-term** (Next quarter):
- üìã Implement comprehensive scanner test suite
- üìã Add monitoring for 403 rejection rates

### Lessons Learned

**What Went Well**:
- Fast detection (5 min from deploy to user report)
- Quick diagnosis (2 min to identify root cause)
- Minimal downtime (10 min MTTR)

**What Could Be Improved**:
- Edge case testing before deployment
- Integration tests for primary user workflows
- Consider default path testing in review checklist

### Metrics

- **Detection time**: 5 minutes
- **Response time**: 2 minutes  
- **Resolution time**: 3 minutes
- **MTTR**: 10 minutes

- **Git commits**: [Path validation fix]

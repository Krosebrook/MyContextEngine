## Example: Scanner Production Readiness

**Analysis Type**: Production Readiness  
**Date**: 2024-10-25  

### Executive Summary
Scanner feature is functional but lacks production-critical safeguards. Rate limiting (P0) must be implemented before public release. Progress streaming (P1) would significantly improve UX for large directory scans. User-configurable whitelist (P2) adds flexibility without compromising security.

### Gap Matrix

| Capability | Current | Required | Gap Size | Priority | Effort | Risk |
|------------|---------|----------|----------|----------|--------|------|
| Rate Limiting | ❌ None | 10 req/min per user | High | P0 | M (2-3h) | Low |
| Scan Caching | ❌ None | 5min TTL | Medium | P1 | M (3-4h) | Low |
| Progress Streaming | ❌ Batch only | SSE/WebSocket | High | P1 | L (4-6h) | Medium |
| Whitelist UI | ❌ Hardcoded | User-configurable | Medium | P2 | M (2-3h) | Low |
| Error Recovery | ⚠️ Basic retry | Partial scan resume | Low | P3 | L (1 week) | High |

### Detailed Gap Analysis

#### Gap 1: Rate Limiting
**Current**: No rate limiting on `/api/scanner/scan` or `/api/scanner/import`  
**Required**: 10 requests/minute per tenant, 429 response with retry-after header  
**Impact**: Vulnerable to abuse, filesystem DoS, excessive API costs  
**Recommendation**: Add Express rate-limit middleware with Redis/memory store  
**Effort Estimate**: 2-3 hours (install package, configure, test)  
**Dependencies**: None  

#### Gap 2: Progress Streaming
**Current**: Batch response after entire scan completes (can take 30+ seconds)  
**Required**: Real-time progress updates via Server-Sent Events (SSE) or WebSocket  
**Impact**: Poor UX for large directory scans, users think it's frozen  
**Recommendation**: Implement SSE endpoint that emits progress events  
**Effort Estimate**: 4-6 hours (SSE setup, frontend integration, testing)  
**Dependencies**: None  

### Recommended Roadmap

**Phase 1** (Week 1):
- [ ] Implement rate limiting (P0) - Blocks abuse
- [ ] Add scan result caching (P1) - Improves performance

**Phase 2** (Week 2):
- [ ] Build progress streaming (P1) - Enhances UX

**Phase 3** (Week 3+):
- [ ] User-configurable whitelist (P2) - Adds flexibility
- [ ] Partial scan resume (P3) - Nice to have

### Metrics & Success Criteria

- Rate limit violations: 0 successful attacks
- Average scan perceived latency: <2s (with streaming)
- User satisfaction with progress feedback: 8+/10
